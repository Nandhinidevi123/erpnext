"""
Welcome to the Deprecation Dumpster: Where Old Code Goes to Party! 🎉🗑️

This file is the final resting place (or should we say, "retirement home"?) for all the deprecated functions and methods of the ERPNext app. It's like a code nursing home, but with more monkey-patching and less bingo.

Each function or method that checks in here comes with its own personalized decorator, complete with:
1. The date it was marked for deprecation (its "over the hill" birthday)
2. The ERPNext version in which it will be removed (its "graduation" to the great codebase in the sky)
3. A user-facing note on alternative solutions (its "parting wisdom")

Warning: The global namespace herein is more patched up than a sailor's favorite pair of jeans. Proceed with caution and a sense of humor!

Remember, deprecated doesn't mean useless - it just means these functions are enjoying their golden years before their final bow. Treat them with respect, and maybe bring them some virtual prune juice.

Enjoy your stay in the Deprecation Dumpster, where every function gets a second chance to shine (or at least, to not break everything).
